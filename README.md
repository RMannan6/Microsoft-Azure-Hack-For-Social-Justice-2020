# PrivIQ

PrivIQ is an application that showcases whether a company collects the user's personal information when the user is browsing a website.

In order to open this extension, you will need to clone the files to your text-editor (or if you prefer: download the code as a ZIP File). Then go to chrome://extensions and activate the developer mode. From there, you will need to unload the PrivIQ folder and it should activate the extension.

If this does not work, you can access the browser version of the extension through the file "popup.html", simply right-click and hit "open as browser" and you should be able to view the extension.

We hope you have a wonderful day!
